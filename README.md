Note: These are some known bugs that we will work to fix.
-	The ‘Home page’ will display the loading spinner when there are no shifts to display. 
-	Some actions will happen in the background, if the app looks like it hasn’t done what you want give it a few seconds. We are currently working on giving visual feedback to the user.
-	We are currently working on adding the ability to manage nurses in their ward by tapping on the nurse.
-	You cannot currently change the name of your ward
-	You currently cannot edit a shift once it has been made

Instructions:
1.	Open the ShiftCare App<br>
**Charge Nurse**<br>
2.	Select ‘Charge Nurse Sign Up’ and enter your details. Then Select ‘Create Account’
3.	You will be redirected to the ‘Home Page’. Here the charge nurse can view the upcoming shifts for their ward and manage those shifts.
4.	Select ‘Profile’ to see and edit your profile information.
5.	Select ‘Nurses’ to see a list of nurses for the ward. 
a.	Click the plus (+) button on the top right to add/invite a nurse to your ward.  
b.	Enter the email of the nurse you want to add (the phone invite hasn’t been added yet) and press ‘Send Invitation’ to send an email invitation to that nurse.
c.	Add a couple of fake nurses if you want.
6.	Select ‘Ward’ to view your ward information page. Here is where the shifts you create are displayed and managed.
a.	Press the plus (+) button on the top right to add a new shift to the ward.
b.	Here you can select the start and end time for the shift, as well as choose the number of nurses the shift requires and the individual nurses for the shift. Then press ‘Add shift’. Add a couple more for good measure.
7.	Select ‘Shifts’ to see a calendar view of the shifts for the ward.
8.	Select ‘Home’ to see the upcoming shifts. (come back here after you log in as a nurse and drop a shift). Here the charge nurse can select the number and filter the upcoming shifts.
9.	Select ‘profile’, scroll to the bottom and press the ‘logout’ button.<br>
**Nurse**<br>
10.	Enter your email for the nurse you invited and the password you set from the confirmation email and press ‘Log in’.
11.	As this is your first time logging in you will be prompted to set your details, do this and then press ‘Create Account’.
12.	You will be directed to the ‘Home page’ here nurses can view shifts that require nurses and can choose to apply for those shifts.
13.	Selecting profile takes you to a similar page to the charge nurse profile where you can see and edit your information.
14.	Select ‘Shifts’ and you see a similar calendar view as the charge nurse. 
a.	Find a day that you created a shift on and select it to view the shift.
b.	Long press the shift by holding down on it and a popup should appear asking if you want to drop the shift (note you have to have been assigned to be able to drop it so if the pop up doesn’t appear try another shift that you were assigned to).
c.	After the popup appears, press ‘Drop’. Selecting the day (or reloading the page) will show that shift now highlighted in red.
15.	Select ‘Home’ again and you should see the shift you just dropped appear. 
a.	Ideally you should log out and log in with a different nurse account before you do the next step but it is not absolutely necessary. 
b.	Press ‘Accept a Shift’ to apply for that shift. Charge nurses will be able to see that you have applied. 
16.	Logout and log back in to the charge Nurse account.<br>
**Charge Nurse**<br>
17.	After logging in with the original charge nurse account you should see on the ‘Home’ page that a shift is highlighted in red (change the filter to ‘dropped’ or ‘all’ if you can’t see it). 
a.	Press on the red shift and you should see a list of nurses that have applied for the shift. (log into more nurse accounts and apply for the shift to get more nurses in the shift).
b.	The last of this functionality is currently under construction however this should give a good idea of how a flow of activities should be carried out.
18.	Play around! See if you can break anything (be sure to let us know if you can). This is still an alpha (pre-release) version of the app, most pages will undergo a major visual overhaul by the time we release the beta version.


Thanks for Testing the app,
